# 🚀 Personal Portfolio Website

A modern, responsive personal portfolio website built to showcase my background in Computer Science, cybersecurity interests, and hands-on technical projects. This site serves as a central hub for my resume, skills, and project work, and is designed with clean UI, smooth animations, and scalability in mind.

## React + Vite + Tailwind Portfolio

This project is a modern single-page portfolio application built with React and powered by Vite for fast development and optimized production builds. It follows a component-driven architecture and uses Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling to maintain consistency and scalability across the UI.

The application separates reusable components, page-level sections, and static data into clearly defined directories. Project and experience data are centralized to simplify updates without modifying presentation logic, improving maintainability and long-term extensibility.

Animations and visual effects are implemented using lightweight motion libraries and custom components, providing smooth interactions while preserving performance. The overall structure is designed to reflect real-world frontend engineering practices rather than a simple static site.
